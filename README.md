# CS2263_Acquire_Project

This project is a simulated version of the popular board game Acquire. It operates similar to the real life version, but also abides by the following business rules:

Business Rules
All players are initialized with starting money (6000)
No paper money is used, bills are not counted as all transactions are digital
No information cards are issued as all players will have necessary information calculated.
Who goes first is taken into account after initialization and is also done without player interaction
An open display is used as it is to be assumed that all people playing this are inexperienced
We assume each player can always see their own tiles
